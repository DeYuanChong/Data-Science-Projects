# Data Science Projects

This repository contains 3 projects that I have been working on since May 2021, and there will be more to come!

1) Body Fat Percentage Regressor: A model that aims to predict body fat percentages based on an individual male's height, weight and various body measurements
2) Component Detector: A model that predicts if an electrical component is correctly orientated or not. This was a spin-off of a technical test that was given in a previous internship role that I interviewed for, which I found interesting
3) Amazon Sentiment Analysis: A model that tries to predict if a given sentence/sentiment is of a positive or negative tone.
